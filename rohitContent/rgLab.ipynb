    "# Setup\n",
    "This is not for N00bs. `python` is just a pain with dependencies.\n",
    "## Welcome to the Matrix\n",
    "A virtual python is necessary to keep from python universes colliding and imploding. As per my best practices guide-lines, we will use `direnv`, `pyenv` and `poetry`, along with `virtualenvwrapper`. Do take this as an exercise in Google-fu.\n",
    "So:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export verPy=\"3.7.0\"\n",
    "export cuteName=\"mySanity\"\n",
    "pyenv install $verPy\n",
    "source /usr/bin/virtualenvwrapper_lazy.sh\n",
    "mkvirtualenv -p $HOME/.pyenv/versions/$verPy/python $cuteName\n",
    "echo \"layout virtualenvwrapper $cuteName\" >> .envrc\n",
    "direnv allow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this you have a shiny new mini-python universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Poetry\n",
    "Much like real poetry, this is expressive and deep, but shorter than mucking around with `conda`.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install poetry\n",
    "poetry init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## GUI or IUG\n",
    "So by now we are ready for graphical user interfaces or interfacing with ugly geeks. Let us use `jupyter-notebooks` because somehow there's a lot of free compute for them. This section is inspired by [this blog](https://anbasile.github.io/programming/2017/06/25/jupyter-venv/)\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry add ipython seaborn matplotlib pandas numpy scipy sklearn ipykernel\n",
    "poetry run jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "The astute reader will notice that we have magically also added the necessary packages for the rest of this notebook."
