# About

This is for my TA interview. I have liberally used the following content to
present the ideas in a coherent manner -

- [Ian Goodfellow's original paper on GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)
- [The univ.ai content](https://github.com/univai-summerschool-2019/GenerativeModels)
- [This neat blogpost](https://blog.evjang.com/2016/06/generative-adversarial-nets-in.html), and [its github repo](https://github.com/ericjang/genadv_tutorial/)
- [This distill.pub post](https://distill.pub/2019/gan-open-problems/)

## Note

I have no intention of using `ipynb` notebooks in the long-run. However I have
opted to do so here, in case I might need to modify the code.
